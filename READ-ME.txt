Dennis Watsuma, the author and architect of the Finch car rental agency platform has used
the following plug ins for the client side:
HTML
CSS
PHP
Bootstap 5
JavaScript
JQuerry

Nevertheless, the project does not meet the qualities of the server side thus ascertaning
the author to use XAMPP software to act as the loacl server. The project has had its table
of cars for hire on a local simple XAMPP server for the sake of examination and presentation
of the project.

To succeed in this, open up your XAMPP local server in your machine and start up the APACHE
servers and the MySQL server domaind. On your local browser open up loacalhost/phpmyadmin
to have access to the server.

Thats all for the User manual. Good luck John!
